Normal PWM Fan Pinout

PinNr Color Function
1 Red		12V Power Supply
2 Black		GND
3 Yellow	Tacho out /Fan-Speed Signal out(open-collector)
4 Blue		PWM control input (100% PWM = max speed, 0% PWM = stop)


Attention Delta Fan PFC0912DE 4.23A 12V has inverse pinout. Pin 3 Yellow and pin 4 Blue functions are swapped.
3 Yellow = PWM control input
4 Blue = Fan-Speed out

Additional the PWM levels are inverted:
0% PWM = max speed
100% PWM = stop
